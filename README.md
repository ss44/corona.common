corona.common
=============

Common modules used in some of my Corona projects, for common tasks.

app_rate
---------
Displays a 'Rate our app' dialog after an app has been run when any of the following conditions are met: 
* total runs
* total time used.
* time after initial install.


transition_pauser
-----------------
Added ability to pause a transition mid sequence. Useful for when needing to add pause events to a game..

device_detect
-------------
Inspired by a similar module that seems to have dissapeared from the internet. Allows to quickly drill down and find the given device by handling all the various if statements. 

iap_check
---------
While lua does much of the heavy work when it comes to handling iap_purchases this just goes that extra step by helping cache purchased items, allow to check if an iap has been made and also seemlessly restoring previosly bought iap purchases.
